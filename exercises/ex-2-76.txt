1) Generic operations with explicit dispatch
   - For each new type, every procedure has to be extended, in order to work with that new type.
   - For each new operation, only a single procedure needs to be written, but it must support all the existing types.

2) Data-directed style
   - For each new type, all the needed operations need to be put into the table.
   - For each new operation, the implementations for all types need to be put into the table.

3) Message-passing style
   - For each new type, a new set of procedures has to be implemented.
   - For each new operation, all the existing types have to be extended.

A) Adding new types
   - Both explicit dispatch and message passing allow to just add the new type, without modifying the existing code.

B) Adding new operations
   - Data-directed style allows to just add new operations, without modifying the existing code.

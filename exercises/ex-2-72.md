Considering an alphabet of size `n` and frequencies, `1,2,4,â€¦,2^(n-1)` (as in
exercise 2.71), there are `2n-1` tree nodes in total. Each node has a symbol
list with a length of `1..2^n-1`, i.e. `(2^n-1)/2` in average.

A binary search to descend the three requires `log(2n-1)` steps. For each node,
the symbol needs to be searched in a length of `(2^n-1)/2`, which requires
`(1+(2^n-1)/2)/2 = 1+(2^n-1)/4` steps on average.

Encoding a symbol, thus, requires `log(2n-1) * 1+(2^n-1)/4` steps.

You can add anything to a given formula, if you also add the reverse operation
to the same formula; say, you add 5 and then remove 5, or you multiply
something by 2 and than divide it by 2. This, however, is not true for interval
arithmetics, in which the error bounds increase with each additional operation.

In order to get more accurate results, the number of redundant operations must
be reduced as much as possible. I could think of no way to proof that for any
formula.

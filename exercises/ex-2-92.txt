A polynomial in x can have coefficients that are aither numbers, polynomials
(in x or in another variable), are a mix thereof:

Numbers:

    2x^3 + 4x^2 + 3x + 1

Polynomials in x:

    (x+3)x^3 + (2x^2+x)x^2 + (x^3+5)x + (x^2+1)

Polynomials in y:

    (y+3)x^3 + (2y^2+y)x^2 + (y^3+5)x + (y^2+1)

Polynomials in both x and y:

    (x+3)x^3 + (2y^2+y)x^2 + (x^3+5)x + (y^2+1)

Multiplying such a polynomial with a polynomial in another variable requires to
convert one of the polynomials so that it becomes a polynomial in the other
variable. This requires multiplying all the terms and factorizing them to the
other variable.

In order to solve this problem, the problem of factorization needs to be solved.

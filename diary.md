I deleted my old SICP repository (containing some exercises on the first
chapter) both on GitHub and on my backup computer, however not on the
corresponding backup disk.

I figured out how to install MIT Scheme on Arch Linux, which now requires an
AUR package, since MIT Scheme is no longer among the officially supported Arch
Linux packages.

I also updated my setup instructions for Geiser and started with a fresh Emacs
setup.

I started reading the book in the morning and then set up this new repository.
I'm getting acquainted with Geiser again and took some notes about the basic
usage.

I read until p. 17 about applicative-order and normal-order evaluation, and took
some notes.

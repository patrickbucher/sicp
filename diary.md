With pen and paper, and some thinking and thinkering, I was able to solve
exercise 1.16. Now I'm further in SICP then I was at my last attempt.

# 2022-08-09 (Tu)

I did exercise 1.15, whose definition I first struggled to understand.

# 2022-08-08 (Mo)

I did exercise 1.14, which took me quite long to do.

# 2022-08-07 (Su)

I did exercise 1.12, which was fairly easy. Exercise 1.13 was rather hard, but I
eventually figured out the proof, which I also wrote down as a nice LaTeX
formula.

I worked on exercise 1.11, which took me a long time, but I managed to finish it
eventually on my own.

# 2022-08-05 (Fr)

I worked on exercise 1.9, which was quite easy. Exercise 1.10 was more tedious
and more difficoult. I was unable to figure out the mathematical definition of
h(n), which was recursive, after all.

# 2022-08-04 (Th)

I read about recursion and tail-call optimization up to page 36 and implemented
the two factorial procedures.

# 2022-08-03 (We)

I worked through exercises 1.7 and 1.8. Then I read up to page 31.

# 2022-08-02 (Tu)

Today, I only read the section on the iterative computation of square roots
(using the "Newton method"). I first implemented the algorithm iteratively in
Python, then typed in the Scheme code. I also worked through exercise 1.6.

# 2022-08-01 (Mo)

I read the paragraph about conditionals and predicates, and worked through
exercises 1.1 to 1.5.

# 2022-07-31 (Su)

I started reading the book in the morning and then set up this new repository.
I'm getting acquainted with Geiser again and took some notes about the basic
usage.

I read until p. 17 about applicative-order and normal-order evaluation, and took
some notes.

# 2022-07-30 (Sa)

I deleted my old SICP repository (containing some exercises on the first
chapter) both on GitHub and on my backup computer, however not on the
corresponding backup disk.

I figured out how to install MIT Scheme on Arch Linux, which now requires an
AUR package, since MIT Scheme is no longer among the officially supported Arch
Linux packages.

I also updated my setup instructions for Geiser and started with a fresh Emacs
setup.
